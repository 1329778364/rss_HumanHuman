# rss_HumanHand
This dataset consists of RSS data measured from smartphones carried by two human beings. Two users were required to stand at a certain distance from each other. In particular, distance = {0.2:0.2:2, 3:1:5}. For each distance, both smartphones will broadcast a BLE packet and also scan for the incoming packet for about 1min. The App is configured to log the following information: the truth distance, name of smartphone, MAC address of BLE chipset, the packet payload, RSS values, time elapsed, and timestamp. Two smartphones were used. The name of the smartphones is set to gryphonelab and HTC One M9, respectively.
